I could not get thymeleaf to work on my heroku for some reason, the only thing i can show working it the https://jonmenard-sysc4806.herokuapp.com/test

Ill try an fix it 


*** I manged to fix the error, I had the templates .HTML not .html, for some reason 
this would work on local host but not heroku. The time is 1:59, meaning this error was fixed after the lab finsihed. However the only thing that actually got changed was the .HTML.
